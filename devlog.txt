I updated the design doc with a better visualization of the program components,
as well as splitting off login and logout in the site map. Login is also 
responsible for returning the login error that was encountered. In addition, login
will now be able to go to a list of blogs on top of other sites, and search will
be able to return a list of blogs as well as blog posts. I also changed around the
scope of some roles as well as elaborate on the scope of work that we will be doing.
I also made the readme with important headers and roles for now.

I added the designwiki0 and designwiki1 files (previous permutations)

I updated README with the install instructions and made a superior name for the blog. Also
made a requirement.txt and ensured that app.py was functional (college apps are a pain).

I fixed the dependencies in requirements.txt (as the dependencies were excessive). I also added a few more funcs dedicated for fetching blog post info.
